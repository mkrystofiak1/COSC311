    "# Thoughts and Trials on Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- My first thoughts on how to visualize the data would be to build functions that can report statistics. When trying to visualize the 'type' of each song, I look to the keywords and I would like to know how many of each 'type' appears.\n",
    "- As for the what types of artists tend to play each song, it would be important to classify song types. I.e. what type of song is Sweet Child O' Mine? All of Me? Does a particular artist only sing rock songs? Only use guitar?\n",
    "- Looking at the style of a song, we might not necessarily need the keywords for each song, but can look at the artists already given keywords. For example, if an artist sings Sweet Child O' Mine and Kryptonite, and the artist has the keyword 'rock' and 'guitar', we can begin to connect that those two songs might be 'rock' songs and/or use the 'guitar'.\n",
    "- Similarily, we can check all of the artists that covered a particular song, and see if all of those artists have the keyword 'rock' or 'guitar', and make a more definitive assumption that the song is indeed a rock song. I would use some sort of bar graph to graph two things: the number of times a song is covered and the number of times the artist that sang the song holds a certain keyword. For example, if Sweet Child O' Mine is sang by 5 artists, and only 4 out of 5 of those artists hold the keyword 'rock', then we can see visualually in a bar graph the bar, 5 next to the bar, 4, and we can even statistically say that for that particular 'rock' song, 80% of artists have the keyword 'rock'. We can determine the threshhold of what is an 'acceptable' assumpition, maybe majority rules (>50%)? Here we begin to make a mapping of songs->keywords (this may start to overlap into neural networks (; ).\n",
    "- Some libraries that are definitely going to be useful are the numpy, matplotlib, and pandas. Pandas will give us a very organized dataframe, while matplotlib can plot the results into something we can see. For example, we can plot songs on the x axis to # of times it's been covered (like our song popularity function) and create a line graph to see which point is greater. We can use the popularity to maybe make a pandas dataframe of song -> count and then load that dataframe into matplotlib. Another underestimated and powerful tool is excel! I love excel because it's super easy to highlight and graph, or import and graph.\n",
    "- Pie charts could also be implemented. We can create graphs that categorize songs and artists by type.\n",
    "- For the last response, I sort of already touched on it, but again, I would like to use a mapping from songs covered to the keywords of the artist who covered it. This would let us correlate (based on frequency) what songs belong to what keywords. If the song is sang by 5 artists, and each of those artists have the keyword 'classics', then it can be inferred that the song is 100% a 'classic' song. Also, of those 5 artists, if 3 of them have 'keyboard' and 2 of them have 'slow rhythm', then we might be able to infer that 100% of the artists who covered the song are 'classical', 60% of the artists use 'keyboard' and 40% of the artists use a 'slow rhythm'. If we use a majority rules situation, we can say that the song in question is definitely a 'classic', mostly played on the 'keyboard' and sometimes used in a 'slow rhythm'. If I were spotify trying to provide music to the user's request, I would recommend a song heirarchy of the most that match 'classic','keyboard' and 'slow'.\n",
    "- In the digitally drawn bar graph provided, the white bars represent the times the song was covered and the red bars represent the times it the particular keyword was found with the artists (in this example, 'rock'). If the bars were equal, that means that 100% of the artists had keyword 'rock'. If the bars were very different in sizes, that means that the artists who covered the song didn't really have the keyword (meaning that song most likely is not normally a 'rock' song). This chart can also show the the most popular songs, given by the white bar, which shows the number of times it was covered.\n"
